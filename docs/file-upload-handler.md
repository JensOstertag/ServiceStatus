## File upload handler
PHP stores uploaded files in the ``$_FILES`` array. However, this array is not very trivial to use for multiple file uploads. The [PHP-UploadHelper](https://github.com/JensOstertag/php-uploadhelper) library provides the ``UploadHelper`` class which validates uploaded files and stores them in a more convenient way.

To learn how to use it, please refer to the [PHP-UploadHelper documentation](https://github.com/JensOstertag/php-uploadhelper) as it always reflects the latest version of the library.
