## Curl
You can use the [Curl-Adapter](https://github.com/JensOstertag/curl-adapter) library's `Curl` class to send HTTP GET or POST requests to other servers. The library is a wrapper for PHPs cURL methods.

To learn about how to do that, please refer to the [Curl-Adapter documentation](https://github.com/JensOstertag/curl-adapter) as it always reflects the latest version of the library.
