## Router
To add routes to your project, edit the ``app-routes.php`` file in the ``üìÅ project/`` directory.

To add a route, use
```php
addRoute("HTTP_METHOD", "ROUTE", "TARGET_FILE", "ROUTE_NAME");
```
Replace the phrases
- ``HTTP_METHOD``: The HTTP method parameter prescribes with what HTTP methods the route can be accessed.<br>
  You can set multiple HTTP methods by separating them with a pipe (``|``) character.
- ``ROUTE``: The route describes with what URI the user should get redirected to the target file.<br>
  For more information about how HTTP GET parameters are included in the URI, please read the section <a href="#http-get-parameters">HTTP GET parameters</a> below.
- ``TARGET_FILE``: The target file is the file that the user should get redirected to when he uses the route.<br>
  It is meant to be located in the ``üìÅ htdocs/`` directory and can be any file that the user should get displayed (e.g. PHP scripts, HTML sites, ...).
- ``ROUTE_NAME``: The route name is used by the ``Router::generate`` method.<br>
  For details about that method's abilities, please read the section <a href="#generate-urls">Generate URLs</a> below.

### HTTP GET parameters
With this router, HTTP GET parameters cannot be set by adding e.g. ``?key1=value1&key2=value2`` at the end of the URI. Instead, the parameters are strictly included in the route, e.g.: ``/user/<username>/edit``, with "<username>" being replaced as an actual user name.

To achieve that, you can specify GET parameters as
```
{datatype:key}
```
in a route when you are adding it to the router. The ``datatype`` part prescribes a data type for the parameter. The ``key`` part specifies the name of the parameter and how the value can be accessed from the ``$_GET`` array. Valid data types are:
- ``b`` - Boolean values (``true`` or ``false``)
- ``d`` - Date values (A date formatted as specified in the config under ``DATE_TECHNICAL``)
- ``f`` - Float values
- ``i`` - Integer values
- ``s`` - String values

Therefore, to add the above example route, you would have to use
```php
# We want the route to be accessible by GET and POST methods (GET to access the website, POST to send changes in forms)
# The file that the user should get redirected to is hypothetically called "edit-user.php"
addRoute("GET|POST", "/user/{s:username}/edit", "edit-user.php", "edit-user");
```
The parameter can be accessed in ``edit-user.php`` with
```php
$username = $_GET["username"];
```

### Generate URLs
The ``Router`` class also offers a method to generate routes that you can add into your PHP script to set button or link redirects or similar.

This comes in handy specially if you want the URL of a route with may GET parameters. By handing the route's name and the array of parameters that should be bound into the URL, it will return the URI with all GET parameters set.

Assumed you have already added the following route:
```php
addRoute("GET|POST", "/user/{s:username}/edit", "edit-user.php", "edit-user");
```
You can get the complete URI with
```php
# Returns "/user/<username>/edit"
Router::generate("edit-user", [
    "username" => "<username>"
]);
```
and add it to an ``<a>`` tag in the users profile.
