## Config
The framework provides a configuration file that allows you to configure the functions of the framework and your project.

The configuration file (`app-config.php`) is located in the `üìÅ project/config/` directory. It includes the `üìÑ secrets/config.secret.json` file, where settings that should be ignored in git repositories (e.g. database credentials, parameters that are changed for testing purposes, ...) can be overwritten.
