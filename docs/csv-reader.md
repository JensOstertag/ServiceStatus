## CSV reader
You can use the [CSVReader](https://github.com/JensOstertag/csvreader) library's `CSVReader` class to read CSV files and convert them to arrays.

To learn about how to do that, please refer to the [CSVReader documentation](https://github.com/JensOstertag/csvreader) as it always reflects the latest version of the library.
